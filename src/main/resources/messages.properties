index.welcome=Welcome to the Internationalization with Spring Boot Demonstration Page.
index.paragraph=The following is a verbatim copy of the UTF-8 test page from W3.org.
index.paragraph2=It shows that the page actually displays all the UTF-8 characters properly. So it seems obvious that the broken characters here are because Thymeleaf is not using the correct Character-set.
index.paragraph3=Problem Solved! The problem was that the Thymeleaf template was not being saved as UTF-8. I had to change the encoding in my IDE to UTF-8, and restart the IDE. When I re-loaded the file, I could see the corrupted characters. I edited the pages again and then re-save the file. Now it works perfectly.
